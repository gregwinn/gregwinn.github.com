I have been a software and electrical hardware engineer for over a decade.
Getting my electrical engineering start with the National Association of
Rocketry, building guidance and avoidance systems for high powered rockets.
I have successfully launched many web platforms and SaaS based products. A
United States Air Force veteran, I have also worked and contracted for some of
the top companies and organizations like Ackerman &amp; McQueen, Match.com, and
the NRA.


I am an experienced team leader, and have built many small development teams
for up and coming startups. Often I have taken on business advisory roles to
help align the product leading the business to higher revenues and more
successful launches.


After a few years in the online gaming industry I acquired my first company
and built Tacticalzone.com, a community site for the NovaLogic video game,
Delta Force. TZ became my first sale in 2002 to Playnet Inc. In years
following TZ I helped to build and develop many other top gaming community sites.

**Specialties:** My collection of other programming skills has grown to include
XHTML, CSS, PHP, Python, C#, .NET, MySQL, SQL, Javascript,
jQuery, AngularJS, and Lua. I continue to build my repertoire with the most
up-to-date languages.
